ðŸ§  Simon Says Game
A fun and interactive Simon Says memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸŽ® How It Works:
The game lights up a sequence of colors.

Your job is to repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

Each level adds a new color to the sequence, testing your memory more and more!

One wrong click, and it's game over!
